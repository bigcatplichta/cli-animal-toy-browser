# ToyBrowser

This gem is the basis for a future web page to allow visitors to buy toys for animals in zoos. In this CLI program, a new user is intantiated upon providing your name on startup. The user then chooses an animal from a list, where they can enter input to display additional info about that animal/species, or decide to buy a toy for that animal. Toys and animals donated to are kept track of in the user's profile.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'ToyBrowser'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ToyBrowser

## Usage

Usage is guided by the program when running bin/toy-browser.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` is not needed as tests have not yet been written for this gem. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
